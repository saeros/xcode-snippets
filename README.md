# Xcode Snippets

A sample of the code snippets I use in my everyday iOS development.


## Adding snippets

* Open a project (no matter which) in Xcode and toggle the _Utilities_ sidebar, the one on the right, using <code>&#8997;&#8984;0</code> (or `View / Utilities`).
* On the bottom, there is a panel with four icons in the header. Click on the `{}` icon to open the _Code Snippets Library_.
* In any file (e.g. the `Appdelegate.m`) copy-paste the code from one of these snippets, highlight the code block you just pasted and drag it to the Code Snippet panel. Make sure to match the suggested platform, language, and completion scope. The completion shortcut corresponds to the filename of the code snippet.


## Using snippets

In an appropriate file (e.g. `.h` or `.m`) type the first characters of the snippet shortcut and when Xcode's autocomplete is on the snippet name hit enter (<code>&#8629;</code>).
